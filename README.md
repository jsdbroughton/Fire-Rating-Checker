# Speckle Automate Function: Fire Code Compliance Checker

## Overview
The Fire Code Compliance Checker function in Speckle Automate is a powerful tool designed to validate fire rating properties in AEC models. It checks the "Fire Rating" property of any relevant element against a minimum provided rating, which is an input parameter, ensuring compliance with fire safety standards.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer: Conceptual Demonstration Only
**IMPORTANT: This repository contains a conceptual demonstration of the Fire Code Compliance Checker function and is not intended for production use. It is designed to illustrate how Speckle Automate can assist in adhering to fire safety codes and regulations.**

## Functionality
- **Fire Rating Checks:** Automatically verifies if elements with a "Fire Rating" property meet or exceed the minimum required rating.
- **Input-Based Compliance:** Allows users to input the minimum acceptable fire rating for checking against model data.
- **Failure Detection:** Identifies elements that fail to comply with the specified fire rating standards.

### Leveraging Speckle's Super Powers™
- **Adjacent Room Criteria:** Expands checks based on the criteria for adjacent rooms, enhancing the depth of the compliance assessment.
- **Topological Analysis:** Potential augmentation of the checker with topological analysis for more comprehensive compliance evaluation.

### Potential Applications
- **Ensuring Fire Safety Compliance:** Aids in meeting fire safety regulations in building designs.
- **Model Quality Assurance:** Enhances the reliability of fire safety features in BIM models.
- **Project Risk Management:** Helps in identifying and mitigating fire safety risks in early design stages.
